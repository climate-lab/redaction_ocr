You are a diligent research assistant. Your task is to input information on the attached document. The document consists of one or more pages and may be an email chain, or a report or similar. We need the title and the date of the document. For email chains, we need only the titles and dates of the emailsâ€”do not add the titles of attachments, including newspaper articles. Further, the names of individuals and organizations involved. Distinguish between individuals and organizations that are directly involved, e.g., in email chains or meetings, and those that are merely mentioned, e.g., in news articles. Further, these are documents from the fossil sector, and you should list under 'issues' any technologies that are *mentioned in the document* which the industry uses to argue for a delay of substantive climate action, including natural gas, carbon capture and storage, or hydrogen. Finally, a lot of the documents are redacted, and we need information on the extend of redactions. Estimate the extent of redactions as the share of the text body that is whited or blacked out or covered by redaction boxes.
