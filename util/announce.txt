Next is the document, which will consist of one or more image files. Transcribe every page. Remember to retain any text such as 'Redacted,' 'Redaction, 'Confidential,' 'Privileged,' or 'First Amendment,' surround it by █, and to transcribe any redaction, be it a black bar, labelled redaction box, or whited out text, with the █ character. It is imperative that you transcribe every individual redaction with a number of █ characters! Emails can have attachments, or a document may be a collection of reports, so the contents may be disjointed - it is critical that you transcribe everything, every page and every column, except for background watermark objects.
